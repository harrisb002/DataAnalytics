# Excel Portfolio Project

## Project Instructions

Assume that budget and gross amounts are in US dollars.

### Your workbook should answer the following questions:

- **How have gross revenues changed over time?**
- **How have inflation-adjusted revenues changed over time?**
  - Copy the table from here into the workbook:  
    [Consumer Price Index Table](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-)
  - **Note:** The “Annual Percent Change (rate of inflation)” column is incorrect.

### Steps:

1. **Create a new column in the `movies` worksheet called “CPI of Release Year.”**

   - Using a lookup function, create a new column for the CPI for the year the film was released.

2. **Create a new column in the `movies` worksheet called “Gross Revenue in 2023 Dollars.”**

   - Using the CPI of the release year and the 2023 CPI, calculate the gross revenue in 2023 dollars.

3. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If your lookup function is not working (you’re seeing a lot of `#N/A`), please rewatch the provided instructional video before asking for help.

### Further Analysis:

Use `sum(gross) / sum(budget)` to calculate gross relative to budget.

- **Do movies with higher scores tend to have higher gross relative to budget?**
- **Do R-rated films tend to have higher gross relative to budget compared with other films?**
- **Do certain genres tend to have higher gross relative to budget?**
- **At a high level, what recommendations can you make about what types of films tend to have the highest gross relative to budget?**

### Summary Worksheet:

- Include a **“Summary”** worksheet in the workbook that summarizes your insights.

## 🚀 Project Scope

### 🎥 **Revenue Trends Over Time**

- Analyze how **nominal gross revenue** has changed over the years.
- Adjust all revenue figures for **inflation** to ensure accurate comparisons.
- **CPI Adjustment:** Use historical Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to normalize gross revenue to **2023 dollars**.

### 💰 **Financial Performance Analysis**

- Determine **which types of films maximize return on investment (ROI)** using:  
  \[
  \text{Gross Relative to Budget} = \frac{\sum(\text{Gross Revenue})}{\sum(\text{Budget})}
  \]
- Answer key business questions:  
  🔹 **Do movies with higher critic scores yield better ROI?**  
  🔹 **Are R-rated films more profitable than other ratings?**  
  🔹 **Which genres have the highest gross-to-budget ratio?**

### 📊 **Data Processing & Insights**

- Use **Excel functions** (LOOKUPs, formulas, PivotTables) to process & analyze large datasets.
- Create a **Summary Dashboard** to present actionable insights for decision-makers.
